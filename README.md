# DSA-Lab
Rep for all my DSA Lab assignments.
Each folder contains the code for that lab, along with the problem statement, test cases and the input file.
If you want to run the code, put the 'lab_number.extension' file and all other files in the same directory, and run the testcases files. Check and make sure that the paths are working correctly.
